The purpose of this project is to go beyond simple shot counting in basketball.  
It aims to help players:
- Control and evaluate their shooting pose
- Train themselves with feedback
- Receive guidance to improve shooting technique

Unlike existing apps that only count shots or focus on dribbling, this project focuses on shooting pose correction and training advice.

## Current Status
- A custom dataset has been created and cleaned
- Hoop detection is working reliably
- Ball trajectory and scoring system are implemented
- Double counting issue during mid-level shots has been resolved
- A minimap for player and ball visualization has been added (still needs refinement during player jumps)

## Future Work
- Improve pose correction using keypoint detection methods
- Provide personalized training feedback based on body alignment and release angle
- Add shot analysis tools (release angle, stability, follow-through evaluation)
- Enhance minimap projection for smoother tracking
- Mobile deployment for real-time use
